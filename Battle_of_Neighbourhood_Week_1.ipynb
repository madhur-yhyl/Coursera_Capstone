We expect to see them in schools, offices and even hotel lobbies and luckily, nowadays we are rarely disappointed."

    "Different locations will prefer different taps because of the type of customer they have. School drinking fountains and gym fountains will have a constant need for small quick bursts of water and this is exactly what the bubbler tap is designed for.  While offices and professional areas are unlikely to want their staff to be dipping down to catch a quick mouthful of water. It hardly gives off the best professional image. The bubbler tap allows the user to quickly dip down, filling their mouth with refreshment and then get on with their day. Even those who are not being active might be in need of a quick drink, such as in between classes or after lunch."

Most are in parks and playgrounds while some can also be found along main roads or near tourist attractions. Sydney water fountains are not only useful, they are something of a tourist attraction in themselves - with some more than 100 years old.\n"
